### Reflection

During the making of this program, I would say that it really changes how objects could be made. Inheritance is a really important feature as it allows multiple items to be created without repetition in the code. I feel like I could have added more abstract classes for sprites like Text.

Furthermore, I have also developed a liking for regular functions / subroutines as they really make the code readability increase... In my Engine.py file, I think I could have increased the cleanliness of the _run_ function. 

The new things which I tried through this project was the use of CONTINUE. I have never used it before but I found it very useful in my code. This is because my program tests if gameover / intro / game / halts are true before running the game. Therefore, if I used Pass, the code would run even after the ball touching the ground.

The challenging part would be collision. It required thinking of what specific points should be used to test for collisions... It resulted in me drawing out diagrams to help myself code these collisions.

Note / Question -

- The inheritance, aggregation, polymophrism, etc is all in the file first few lines of the files.
    - block_ball_paddle.py has Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.
    - engine.py has Aggregation

In the flow chart, how do we represent an END for this program. There is no specific Exit button or win scenario in my game... The only way of exiting is to hit the close button.
